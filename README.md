## About:
Twenny is an open source hardware and software project aiming to reduce eye strain while working on screens. By periodically interrupting the time spent looking at close screens with 20 seconds of far gazing, the negtive impact of screen time could be reduced (peer reviewed studies have yet to empirically prove or disprove this...).

## Dev-Log:
CAD: First prototype has been completed, keycap design might need improvement

Software: Current firmware running stable, more functions should be implemented, such as silent mode (notify on computer), snake in hidden menu.

Design: Animations coming (?)

Scematics: Redesign for PCB maufacturing (?)
